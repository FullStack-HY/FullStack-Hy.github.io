<div class="intro">

_THIS PART HAS NOT YET BEEN UPDATED_

So far, we have placed the application's state and state logic directly inside React-components. When applications grow larger, state management should be moved outside React-components. In this part, we will introduce the Redux-library, which is currently the most popular solution for managing the state of React-applications.

Exercise deadline for this part (and part 7) Monday 13.3.
