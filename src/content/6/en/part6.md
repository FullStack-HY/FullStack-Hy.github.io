<div class="intro">

So far, we have placed the application's state and state logic directly inside React-components. When applications grow larger, state management should be moved outside React-components. In this part, we will introduce the Redux-library, which is currently the most popular solution for managing the state of React-applications. 

Exercise deadline for this part (and part 7) Monday 14.3.
